# Perlin Noise Generator
This is based on my [Game-of-Life](https://pages.github.com/) repo. Implemented Perlin Noise from scratch, going to try to evolve this into a terrain generator.

Screenshots from the lastest update (Below). Zoomed in on a smaller section of the landscape, flattened oceans, color-coded different altitudes, added diffuse lighting.

The same 4 Layers of Perlin Noise from the 2D Screenshots used to offset the height of a flat plane. Positive heights are green, negative heights are blue.

Perlin Noise colored with some trig functions, from the [2D-Noise](https://github.com/gusjengis/Perlin-Noise-Generator/tree/2D-Noise) branch.

4 Layers of Perlin Noise colored in the same way, from the [2D-Noise](https://github.com/gusjengis/Perlin-Noise-Generator/tree/2D-Noise) branch.
